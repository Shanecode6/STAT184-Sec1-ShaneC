This repository contains an analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset using R. The goal of the project is to clean, summarize, and visualize the data to explore patterns in penguin species, islands, and body mass distributions. through data filtering and visualization, the project highlights trends and relationships in penguin data to understand their ecological characteristics.

The analysis is based on the palmerpenguins datase.

The dataset includes the following attributes like specie,island bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm ( Measurements of the penguinâ€™s bill) flipper_length_mm (Flipper length) body_mass_g( Penguin body mass in grams) ,sex,year
had A series of visualizations are created to explore patterns in the data like Body Mass by Species ( A boxplot comparing body mass distributions for penguins on different islands) and Body Mass by Island ( A boxplot showing how body mass varies between species).

you can use any G plot for body mass by species i used  [ ggplot(penguins_filtered, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_boxplot()]
Key Finding were The boxplots revealed variations in body mass across islands, with noticeable differences between islands like Biscoe and Dream.
